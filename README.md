üåü Overview
ReliefCare is an advanced doctor appointment booking application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application aims to streamline the healthcare experience by allowing patients to find doctors nearby, book appointments, and engage in online consultations‚Äîall from the comfort of their homes. The core concept addresses real-life challenges faced by patients, such as long hospital queues and complex appointment procedures.

üîÑ Processes & Approaches
1. User Journey
User Registration & Authentication: Patients can register and log in using their credentials. The authentication process ensures secure access to the platform.

Doctor Search & Filtering: Users can search for doctors based on specialization, location, and availability. Advanced filtering options help narrow down choices.

Appointment Booking: Once a suitable doctor is found, patients can book appointments directly through the platform.

Payment Integration: Secure payment gateways facilitate online payments for consultations.

2. Admin Workflow
Doctor Management: Admins can add, update, or remove doctor profiles, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

Appointment Oversight: Admins have access to all appointments, allowing them to monitor and manage bookings effectively.

User Management: Admins can manage user accounts, addressing any issues or concerns promptly.

Analytics Dashboard: The admin panel provides insights into platform usage, helping in data-driven decision-making.

üñ•Ô∏è User Interface (UI)
The UI is designed with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness:

Modern Aesthetics: Clean layouts with intuitive navigation enhance user experience.

Responsiveness: The application is optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Interactive Elements: Features like real-time search, dynamic filters, and interactive calendars improve user engagement.

Accessibility: High contrast modes and keyboard navigability cater to users with different accessibility needs.

üß± Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust foundation for the application:

API Development: RESTful APIs handle client requests, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and database.

Database Integration: MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database, storing user data, doctor profiles, appointments, and payment records.

Security Measures: Implementations like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) ensure secure authentication and authorization processes.

Scalability: The backend architecture is designed to handle increased loads, supporting future growth.

üõ†Ô∏è Admin Panel
The admin panel is a crucial component for platform management:
